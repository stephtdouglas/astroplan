Introduction to Built-In Constraints
====================================

Frequently, we have a long list of targets that we want to observe, and we need
to know which ones are observable given a set of constraints imposed on our
observations by a wide range of limitations. For example, your telescope may
only point over a limited range of altitudes, your targets are only useful
in a range of airmasses, and they must be separated from the moon by some
large angle. The ``constraints`` module is here to help!

Say we're planning to observe from Subaru Observatory in Hawaii on August 1,
2015 from 06:00-12:00 UTC. First, let's set up an `~astroplan.Observer` object::

    from astroplan import Observer, FixedTarget
    from astropy.time import Time
    subaru = Observer.at_site("Subaru")
    time_range = Time(["2015-08-01 06:00", "2015-08-01 12:00"])

We're keeping a list of targets in a text file called ``targets.txt``, which
looks like this::

    # name ra_degrees dec_degrees
    Polaris 37.95456067 89.26410897
    Vega 279.234734787 38.783688956
    Albireo 292.68033548 27.959680072
    Algol 47.042218553 40.955646675
    Rigel 78.634467067 -8.201638365
    Regulus 152.092962438 11.967208776

We'll read in this list of targets using `astropy.table`, and create a list
of `~astroplan.FixedTarget` objects out of them::

    # Read in the table of targets
    from astropy.table import Table
    target_table = Table.read('targets.txt', format='ascii')

    # Create astroplan.FixedTarget objects for each one in the table
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    import astropy.units as u
    targets = [FixedTarget(coord=SkyCoord(ra=ra*u.deg, dec=dec*u.deg), name=name)
               for name, ra, dec in target_table]

We will build a bulleted list of our constraints first, then implement them in
code below.

* Our observations with Subaru can only occur between altitudes of ~10-80
  degrees, which we can define using the
  `~astroplan.constraints.AltitudeConstraint` class.

* We place an upper limit on the airmass of each target during observations
  using the `~astroplan.constraints.AirmassConstraint` class.

* Since we're optical observers, we only want to observe targets at night, so
  we'll also call the `~astroplan.constraints.AtNightConstraint` class. We're
  not terribly worried about sky brightness for these bright stars, so we'll
  define "night" times as those between civil twilights by using the class
  method `~astroplan.AtNightConstraint.twilight_civil`:

.. code-block:: python

    from astroplan import (AltitudeConstraint, AirmassConstraint,
                           AtNightConstraint)
    constraints = [AltitudeConstraint(10*u.deg, 80*u.deg),
                   AirmassConstraint(5), AtNightConstraint.twilight_civil()]

This list of constraints can now be applied to our target list to determine:

* whether the targets are observable given the constraints at *any* times in the
  time range, using `~astroplan.is_observable`,

* whether the targets are observable given the constraints at *all* times in the
  time range, using `~astroplan.is_always_observable`

* during what months the targets are *ever* observable given the constraints,
  using `~astroplan.months_observable`::

    from astroplan import is_observable, is_always_observable, months_observable
    # Are targets *ever* observable in the time range?
    ever_observable = is_observable(constraints, subaru, targets, time_range=time_range)

    # Are targets *always* observable in the time range?
    always_observable = is_always_observable(constraints, subaru, targets, time_range=time_range)

    # During what months are the targets ever observable?
    best_months = months_observable(constraints, subaru, targets)

The `~astroplan.is_observable` and `~astroplan.is_always_observable` functions
will return boolean arrays which tell you whether or not each target is
observable given your constraints. Let's print these results in tabular form:

    >>> from astropy.table import Table
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> observability_table = Table()
    >>> observability_table['targets'] = [target.name for target in targets]
    >>> observability_table['ever_observable'] = ever_observable
    >>> observability_table['always_observable'] = always_observable
    >>> print(observability_table)
    <Table length=6>
    targets ever_observable always_observable
      str7        bool             bool
    ------- --------------- -----------------
    Polaris            True              True
       Vega            True              True
    Albireo            True             False
      Algol            True             False
      Rigel           False             False
    Regulus           False             False

Now we can see which targets are observable! You can also use the
`~astroplan.observability_table` method to do the same calculations and
store the results in a table, all in one step::

    >>> from astroplan import observability_table
    >>> table = observability_table(constraints, subaru, targets, time_range=time_range)
    >>> print(table)
    target name ever observable always observable fraction of time observable
    ----------- --------------- ----------------- ---------------------------
        Polaris            True              True                         1.0
           Vega            True              True                         1.0
        Albireo            True             False              0.833333333333
          Algol            True             False              0.166666666667
          Rigel           False             False                         0.0
        Regulus           False             False                         0.0

Let's sanity-check these results using `~astroplan.plots.plot_sky` to plot
the positions of the targets throughout the time range:

.. plot::

    from astroplan.plots import plot_sky
    from astroplan import Observer, FixedTarget

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib import cm
    from astropy.time import Time
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    import astropy.units as u


    # Get grid of times within the time_range limits
    from astroplan import time_grid_from_range
    time_range = Time(["2015-08-01 06:00", "2015-08-01 12:00"])
    time_grid = time_grid_from_range(time_range)

    subaru = Observer.at_site("Subaru")

    target_table_string = """# name ra_degrees dec_degrees
    Polaris 37.95456067 89.26410897
    Vega 279.234734787 38.783688956
    Albireo 292.68033548 27.959680072
    Algol 47.042218553 40.955646675
    Rigel 78.634467067 -8.201638365
    Regulus 152.092962438 11.967208776"""
    # Read in the table of targets
    from astropy.io import ascii
    target_table = ascii.read(target_table_string)
    targets = [FixedTarget(coord=SkyCoord(ra=ra*u.deg, dec=dec*u.deg), name=name)
               for name, ra, dec in target_table]

    plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
    cmap = cm.Set1             # Cycle through this colormap

    for i, target in enumerate(targets):
        ax = plot_sky(target, subaru, time_grid,
                      style_kwargs=dict(color=cmap(float(i)/len(targets)),
                                        label=target.name))

    legend = ax.legend(loc='lower center')
    legend.get_frame().set_facecolor('w')
    plt.show()

We can see that Vega is in the sweet spot in altitude and azimuth for this
time range and is always observable. Albireo is not always observable given
these criteria because it rises above 80 degrees altitude. Polaris hardly moves
and is therefore always observable, and Algol starts out observable but sets
below the lower altitude limit, and then the airmass limit. Rigel and Regulus
never rise above those limits within the time range.

User-Defined Constraints
========================

There are many possible constraints that you could find useful which have
not been implemented (yet) in astroplan. This example will walk you through
creating your own constraint which will be compatible with the tools in the
``constraints`` module.

We will begin by defining an observer at Subaru and reading the text file of
stellar coordinates defined in the example above::

    from astroplan import Observer, FixedTarget
    from astropy.time import Time
    subaru = Observer.at_site("Subaru")
    time_range = Time(["2015-08-01 06:00", "2015-08-01 12:00"])

    # Read in the table of targets
    from astropy.io import ascii
    target_table = ascii.read('targets.txt')

    # Create astroplan.FixedTarget objects for each one in the table
    from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    import astropy.units as u
    targets = [FixedTarget(coord=SkyCoord(ra=ra*u.deg, dec=dec*u.deg), name=name)
               for name, ra, dec in target_table]

In the previous section, you may have noticed that constraints are assembled by
making a list of calls to the initializers for classes like
`~astroplan.AltitudeConstraint` and `~astroplan.AirmassConstraint`. Each of
those constraint classes is subclassed from the abstract
`~astroplan.Constraint` class, and the custom constraint that we're going to
write must be as well.

In this example, let's design our constraint to ensure that all targets must
be within some angular separation from Vega â€“ we'll call it
``VegaSeparationConstraint``. Two methods, ``__init__`` and
``compute_constraint`` must be written for our constraint to work:

* The ``__init__`` method will accept the minimum and maximum acceptable separations
  a target could have from Vega.

* We'll also define a method ``compute_constraints`` which takes three
  arguments: an array of times to test, an `~astroplan.Observer` object, and
  one or a list of `~astroplan.FixedTarget` objects. ``compute_constraints``
  will return a matrix of booleans that describe whether or not each target
  meets the constraints.  The super class `~astroplan.Constraint` has a
  ``__call__`` method which will run your custom class's
  ``compute_constraints`` method when you check if a target is observable
  using `~astroplan.is_observable` or `~astroplan.is_always_observable`.

Here's our ``VegaSeparationConstraint`` implementation::

    from astroplan import Constraint, is_observable
    from astropy.coordinates import Angle

    class VegaSeparationConstraint(Constraint):
        """
        Constraint the separation from Vega
        """
        def __init__(self, min=None, max=None):
            """
            min : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or `None` (optional)
                Minimum acceptable separation between Vega and target. `None`
                indicates no limit.
            max : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or `None` (optional)
                Minimum acceptable separation between Vega and target. `None`
                indicates no limit.
            """
            self.min = min
            self.max = max

        def compute_constraint(self, times, observer, targets):

            # Vega's coordinate must be non-scalar for the dimensions
            # to work out properly when combined with other constraints which
            # test multiple times
            vega = SkyCoord(ra=[279.23473479]*u.deg, dec=[38.78368896]*u.deg)

            # Calculate separation between target and vega
            vega_separation = Angle([vega.separation(target.coord)
                                     for target in targets])

            # If a maximum is specified but no minimum
            if self.min is None and self.max is not None:
                mask = vega_separation < self.max

            # If a minimum is specified but no maximum
            elif self.max is None and self.min is not None:
                mask = self.min < vega_separation

            # If both a minimum and a maximum are specified
            elif self.min is not None and self.max is not None:
                mask = ((self.min < vega_separation) & (vega_separation < self.max))

            # Otherwise, raise an error
            else:
                raise ValueError("No max and/or min specified in "
                                 "VegaSeparationConstraint.")

            # Return an array that is True where the target is observable and
            # False where it is not
            return mask

Then as in the earlier example, we can call our constraint::

    >>> constraints = [VegaSeparationConstraint(min=5*u.deg, max=30*u.deg)]
    >>> observability = is_observable(constraints, subaru, targets,
    ...                               time_range=time_range)
    >>> print(observability)
    [False False  True False False False]

The resulting list of booleans indicates that the only target separated by
5 and 30 degrees from Vega is Albireo. Following this pattern, you can design
arbitrarily complex criteria for constraints.
